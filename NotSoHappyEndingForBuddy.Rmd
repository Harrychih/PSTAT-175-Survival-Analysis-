abstract: |
  Although Labradors are widely viewed as one of the most popular breeds in the United States, they are also a popular breed found in animal shelters [https://www.cleartheshelters.com](https://www.cleartheshelters.com/10-Most-Adoptable-Dog-Breeds-in-America-375215521.html). Taking a look at the outcomes of over 6,000 Labradors in the Austin Animal Center (the largest "no-kill" animal shelter in the U.S.), we build a Cox Proportional Hazards model to see how neuter status affects Labrador adoption rates.
